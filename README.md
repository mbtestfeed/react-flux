# react-flux
A base project for using React and Flux, served using gulp. Based off of Cory House's Pluralsight course.

From here, you'll still need to add components, routing, and Flux routes, including stores and external calls. This is just the most basic "oh look, I have something that doesn't crash in react" version. More to come.
